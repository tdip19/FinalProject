***While we used census data for the project, it should take minimal space on your computer. It is already downloaded in the inputs folder and uploaded in the get_and_clean.ipynb***  

### Steps to running this repo: 
1. Run the get_and_clean_data file 
1. Run the regression_analysis file 
1. Run the ML_analysis file 

That's it! All neccesary imports are included in each file when ran. The folder should be around 2MB so there should be no problems with space.
